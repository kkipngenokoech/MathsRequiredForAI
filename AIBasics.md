# MATHS FOR AI

machines are in our day to day lives, our world is full of machines

A majority of these machines work by following a set of pre-defined required to complete a task successfully

computer machines and algorithms are at the core of these big and small machines

Algorithms help us to formally define the steps to be executed by a machine, and the computer hardware execute this steps to complete  a task successfully.

With advancement of computing capability, new algorithms to solve more complex problems have evolved.

what in essence we are trying to is to impart human intelligence like reasoning, creativity, analyzing, problem solving ability, and natural languange understanding to computers.

## Artificial intelligence

The field of algorithms that strive to impart human intelligence

AI is a multidisciplinary field of research with a goal to create technology that can enable machines to function like humans. 

Human mind consists of memories, intellect, thoughts (emotions), and a sense of identity. 

Human intellect is the discriminative faculty of the mind that determines whether an action is right or wrong. 

The sense organs present the current situation someone is in, to their intellect. Then, intellect consults the memory, past experiences, present thoughts, and emotions and decides the action. The actions can be speaking, running, smiling, crying, fighting and so on. 

So, for a machine to function like a human, it should have all these capabilities. Well, machines may not have emotions to influence their decisions! But machines must learn from past experiences, and these experiences must influence their decisions.

At first, a machine should have the sense organs by which it can digitally map and record our physical world. Then, it must have the ability to learn from the mistakes it makes.

## AI classification

### Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI)

refers to a computer's ability to perform a single task extremely well.

they include:

1. siri
2. computer playing chess
3. flying aeroplanes
4. recommeding products online

this machines don't think and they also don't have emotions

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

is when a computer program can perform  any intelligent task exactly like a human - human intelligence

They can reason, represent knowledge including common sense, plan, learn, and converse in natural language.

here is where turing test has to be passed

### Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)

this is an AI that surpasses human intelligence, these are machines that have greater problem solving and decision making capabilities that are far superior to human beings

such machines should have consciousness.

## subdomains of AI

they include:

1. Robotics - Gives limbs to AI system
2. Natural language Processing
3. Expert Systems - computer system emulating the decision making ability of a human expert
   - the expert system has two parts:
       - Knowledge base - facts and rules
       - inference engine - applies the rules to the known facts and deduce new facts. 
4. Speech Recognition Genarations - gives ears to the AI system
5. Computer vision - gives eyes to the AI system

AI -> Ml -> DL
