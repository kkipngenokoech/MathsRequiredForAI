    "##  Regularized Linear Regression\n",
    "In many real-world applications, predictive models often encounter challenges such as multicollinearity among features, small sample sizes, or noisy data. These challenges can lead to overfitting, where the model captures noise instead of meaningful patterns. To address this, regularized linear regression, such as ridge regression, introduces a penalty term to the loss function, which helps constrain the model complexity and improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenarios where regularized linear regression plays a critical role:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Financial Forecasting__: Predicting stock prices or company revenues often involves highly correlated features, such as economic indicators or market trends. Ridge regression can reduce the impact of multicollinearity, ensuring stable and interpretable predictions.\n",
    "- __Healthcare Analytics__: In clinical studies with limited patient data, predictive models for treatment outcomes may suffer from high variance due to noise. Regularization helps to avoid overfitting by penalizing extreme weight values.\n",
    "- __Marketing Campaign Analysis__: Estimating the impact of various advertisement strategies on sales can involve sparse and noisy data. Regularization ensures that the model remains robust despite inconsistencies in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem, you will explore ridge regression on synthetic data to understand its behavior and implications for real-world applications. Specifically, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Analyze the behavior of learned coefficients__: Observe how the learned coefficients vary as the regularization parameter λ changes, helping to illustrate how ridge regression stabilizes the model\n",
    "- __Assess model performance__: Measure the model’s performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on validation data to identify the optimal regularization parameter λ\n",
    "- __Investigate the bias-variance trade-off__: Quantify and visualize how regularization influences bias and variance, providing insights into the trade-offs inherent in predictive modeling.\n"
