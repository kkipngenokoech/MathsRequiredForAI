\section{Probability}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A fair coin is tossed 10 times. The sample space for each trial is Head, Tail and the trials are independent. What is the probability of having:
    \[
        P(H) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad P(T) = \frac{1}{2}
    \]
    The probability of getting exactly \( k \) heads
    is given by the binomial distribution:
    \[
        P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
    \]
    where \( n = 10 \) and \( p = \frac{1}{2} \).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Zero Tail
        \[
            P(0T) = \binom{10}{0} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^0 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{10} = \frac{1}{1024}
        \]
        \item 6 heads
        \item At least three heads
        \item At least three Heads given the first trail was a Head!
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
