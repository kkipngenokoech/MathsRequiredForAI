# LINEAR ALGEBRA

the maths required for AI is in four pillars:

1. Linear Algebra
2. vector calculus
3. Probability
4. Statistics

here we are going to discuss Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with vectors and linear function on vectors.

## What is a vector?

A vector is a representation of an abstract object as a mathematical entity. i.e a digital image can be represented as a vector of pixels, you can multiply or add or subtract or divide this vectors made up of pixels.

let’s take two digital images shot from the same camera position. The first is of a lady in front of her house, and the next is of a car with the same background as the lady’s image. If we add these two images, we get a new image with the lady along with a car in front of her house. Many such image operations can be represented with vector operations and transformation of vectors.

## Feature Engineering

an abstract object as a vector is called feature engineering
