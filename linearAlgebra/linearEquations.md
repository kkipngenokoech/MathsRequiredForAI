# LINEAR EQUATIONS

y = mx + c

a linear equation has two variables x and y.

m is the gradient.

c tells us about the x intercept.

Equations of the first order are called linear equations

the general form of linear equation is ax + by + c = 0

the more the variables the more planes an equation can make.

this can be extended to n-dimensions.

When more than one linear equation is represented in n-dimensional space, itâ€™s interesting to analyse common points or intersection points of these hyperplanes represented by these equations. These common points lie on all the hyperplanes simultaneously and are known as solutions of the system of
linear equations.

## EXAMPLE USING LINEAR EQUATION

Consider a situation where a group of friends plan to visit a shopping mall. They plan to spend time on movie, bowling, and play station. With difference of opinion on where to start, they get divided into three groups. After spending time in the mall, they all gather at one place for discussion.

1. this is what the first group spent:

    1. 1 bowling alleys
    2. 1 play stations
    3. 1 movie ticket

    - they spent a total of 1500 ksh
2. this is what the second group spent:

    1. 3 bowling alleys
    2. 4 play stations
    3. 2 movie tickets

    - they spent a total of 4400 ksh
3. this is what the third group spent:
   1. 5 bowling alleys
   2. 3 play stations
   3. 5 movie tickets

   - they spent a total of 6500

with this information you need to come up with the cost of a bowling alley, play station and even the movie ticket.

you can use the x axis for bowling alley, y axis for play station and z axis for the movie ticket.
