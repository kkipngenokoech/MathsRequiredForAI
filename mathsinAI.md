# ROLE OF MATHS IN AI

their is always some uncertainity involved in AI.

this uncertainity comes from:

1. insufficient data
2. noise in data
3. errors while collecting data.
4. assumptions when modelling

we can represent this uncertainity qualitatively with the mathematical theory of probalility and statistics.

## Propability

this provides the foundation and tools for quantifying, handling and harnessing uncertainity

## statistics

this provides us with the methods of collecting presenting analysing intepreting and inferencing from data.

With all these tools, we are equipped to mathematically define decision- making, which is required to automate decision-making from data, that is, to achieve the final goal of AI.

this decisions can be of two types:

1. discrete
2. continuous

Mathematically, discrete decisions can be represented as a way of partitioning the high dimensional space where the data points lie and assigning a category to each partition. Continuous decisions, on the other hand, are some functions mapping a point in high dimensional space to a real number.

## BASIC MATHEMATICAL TOOLS

1. Linear Algebra
2. Vector Calculus
3. Probability
4. Statistics
